uRPC (read: micro-RPC) is a thin layer of glue that provides a cross-language 
remote procedure call library built on Google's Protocol Buffers and iMatrix's 
0MQ message queue. It is designed to be as thin, fast, light, and simple as 
possible, in order to retain efficency and simplicity found in its component 
parts.
