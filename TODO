  * Excel, C#, Mono
    - write client that replicates C++ client (protobuf, ZMQ)
    - integrate client into Excel plugin
    - RTD COM plugin - this is a class created by excel right? What is the best
      way for the RtdServer to communicate with the plugin? 
  
  * src/server.cpp
    - does the queue match connections? (e.g. allow us to keep state?)
    - std::map to delegate API request to function?
    - plugin arch for API functionality
    - how best to seperate server from request processing?
  * src/dns/getdns-win.cpp
    - add error handling for when machine doesn't have DNS configured - WTF is
      api returning when there is no IP address?
    - change memory allocation to smart_ptr
  * src/dns/dns.cpp
    - ibusy DNS
  * src/kerberos/kerberos.cpp
    - fill in stub functionality; test against directory server
  * src/ldap/ldap.cpp
    - need a gameplan here. what is the high level interface? how are we

    - change libraries linked to based on build type DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    - get protobufs generated
    - write Find scripts for Matlab, ZMQ, PB, Kerberos
    - cross platform testing (get single cmake files that work the 3) 
    - bad form to use link_directories?
    - not able to turn matlab off?!
    - does windows need lib prefix added?
