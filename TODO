TODO

  * Excel, C#, Mono
    - write client that replicates C++ client (protobuf, ZMQ)
    - integrate client into Excel plugin
    - RTD COM plugin - this is a class created by excel right? What is the best
      way for the RtdServer to communicate with the plugin? 
  
  * src/client.cpp
    - use zero copy protobuf api
  * src/dns/dns.cpp
    - ibusy DNS
  * src/kerberos/kerberos.cpp
    - fill in stub functionality; test against directory server
  * src/ldap/ldap.cpp
    - need a gameplan here. what is the high level interface? how are we 
      looking to organize the authorization directory?
  * src/server.cpp
    - which threadpool implementation?
    - how to handle stateful connections?
    - abstract request proccessing (e.g. a particular message api call will
      can be automatically deligated to a callback or something similar)
    - (apicall, revision, payload) -> function3
      (apicall, revision, payload) -> function4
  * src/dns/getdns-win.cpp
    - add error handling for when machine doesn't have DNS configured
    - change memory allocation to smart_ptr
   
  * Python (server)
    - urpc namespace that gives basic functionality, or uses platform standard
      modules if available
    - kerberos plugin
    - ldap plugin
    - dns plugin
      
  * CMake
    - change libraries linked to based on build type DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    - get protobufs generated
    - write Find scripts for Matlab, ZMQ, PB, Kerberos
    - cross platform testing (get compiled on FreeBSD image); do we need to 
      set extra parameters to explicitly link boost on BSD?
    - bad form to use link_directories?
  * MATLAB
    - (?) automated, generic way to convert a probuf into an mxArray array of 
      structs, either by code generation or reflection
