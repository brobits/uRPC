TODO

  * Zero Copy
    - figure out how to use for ZMQ
    - figure out how to use for Protobuf

  * client C++ wrapper
    - how do we want to return the message byte blob as a protobuf? how does
      the typing work in this case? is there a protobuf superclass?
    - hooks for authenticaton / authorization
      
  * python server wrapper
    - how can we package up the basic functionality to make writing a server 
      easier?
      
  * C++ DNS
    - cmake: compile win/getdns only if win platform
    - write boost::asio wrapper to get SRV records from DNS server
  
  * CMake
    - change libraries linked to based on build type
    - get protobufs generated
    - write Find scripts for Matlab, ZMQ, PB
    
  * MATLAB
    - refactor to use client C++ wraper
    - need functionality to convert from mxArray to protobuf. 
    - need routine to convert from protobuf array to 2d mxArray. Most likely
      will be specific to TimeSeries as it's performance/memory critical. 
      opportunity to autogenerate code?
    - generic protobuf array to mxArray. what are the reflection capabilities
      of the C++ api?
      
  * Kerberos / LDAP
    - best way to integrate these would be though the client/server wrapper
    - implement as stub functions for now in wrapper 
    - figure out linker / libraries needed for this functionality
    
  * Excel, C#
    - what will the API look like from Excel? Single commands? Sending bulk 
      data? RTD subscriptions?
    - get basic CLR working for ZeroMQ
    - dotnet protobufs - take for a spin
