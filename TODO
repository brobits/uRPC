TODO

  * C++ client (and server?)
    - zero copy ZMQ api
    - zero copy protobuf api
 
  * Python server 
    - how can we package up the basic functionality to make writing a server 
      easier?
      
  * examples
    - test C++ client, write Python server
    
  * CMake
    - change libraries linked to based on build type DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    - get protobufs generated
    - write Find scripts for Matlab, ZMQ, PB, Kerberos
    - cross platform testing (get compiled on FreeBSD image)
    - bad form to use link_directories?
    
  * src/dns
    - write boost::asio wrapper to get SRV records from DNS server
    
  * MATLAB
    - perhaps best to leave a demo of functionality? unless we can write 
      functions that are truly generic not much to do here.
    - need functionality to convert from mxArray to protobuf. 
    - need routine to convert from protobuf array to 2d mxArray. Most likely
      will be specific to TimeSeries as it's performance/memory critical. 
      opportunity to autogenerate code?
    - generic protobuf array to mxArray. what are the reflection capabilities
      of the C++ api?
    
  * Excel, C#
    - KeyValue series best generic way to handle subscriptions, submission of 
      data for general demo? More specific things can be done for Symbology
      which would be way more efficient
    - get basic CLR working for ZeroMQ
    - dotnet protobufs - take for a spin
    
  * src/kerberos
    - map out high level client and server authentication, write stub functions
    - fill in stub functionality; test against directory server
