TODO

  * Excel, C#, Mono
    - write client that replicates C++ client (protobuf, ZMQ)
    - integrate client into Excel plugin
    - RTD COM plugin - this is a class created by excel right? What is the best
      way for the RtdServer to communicate with the plugin? Why can't this
      class be composed as part of our plugin? Do they run as seperate 
      processes?
    
  * src/client.cpp
    - use zero copy ZMQ api
    - use zero copy protobuf api
    - support for multi-part messages (send more, recieve more)
  * src/dns.cpp
    - ibusy DNS
  * examples/cpp/matlabclient.cpp
    - blows up for data > 10kB. Data allocated correctly - are we getting a
      bad pointer somwhere while rewritting?
  * src/kerberos.cpp
    - fill in stub functionality; test against directory server
  * src/ldap.cpp
    - need a gameplan here. what is the high level interface? how are we 
      looking to organize the authorization directory?
  
  * Python (server)
    - urpc namespace that gives basic functionality, or uses platform standard
      modules if available
    - kerberos plugin
    - ldap plugin
    - dns plugin
      
  * CMake
    - change libraries linked to based on build type DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    - get protobufs generated
    - write Find scripts for Matlab, ZMQ, PB, Kerberos
    - cross platform testing (get compiled on FreeBSD image); do we need to 
      set extra parameters to explicitly link boost on BSD?
    - bad form to use link_directories?
  * MATLAB
    - (?) automated, generic way to convert a probuf into an mxArray array of 
      structs, either by code generation or reflection
